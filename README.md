# Sketchily

Sketchily allows the easy integration of [svg-edit](http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/) with any rails application.

Currently supports and provides `svg-edit-2.6`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```rb
gem 'sketchily'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install sketchily
```

Also make sure your `application.js` requires jquery (it usually does by default):

```js
//= require jquery
```

**Note:** sketchily will **automatically** add the following files to your asset precompilation list:

    sketchily.css sketchily.js sketchily_embed.js canvg/canvg.js canvg/rgbcolor.js extensions/ext-*.js locale/lang.*.js

Other html files and images used by svg-edit will also be precompiled.

## Usage

Sketchily adds new form elements which can be accessed by calling:

- `f.sketchily` or simply `sketchily` from inside a `form_for @my_object |f|`
- `sketchily_tag` from inside a `form_tag`

This gem also adds a helper method that can be called to display the resulting SVG images (without an editor):

- `sketchily_show` from any view template

### `sketchily` and `sketchily_tag` functions

- Both of these functions work exactly like the equivalent `hidden_field` functions, except that svg-edit is displayed instead.
- The `f.sketchily` format accepts a method name and an options hash.
- The `sketchily` format (called without the form builder object) accepts an object name, a method name and an options hash.
- The `sketchily_tag` format accepts a tag name, the svg string to be edited and an options hash.

Currently available options are:

- `width` (total width of editor)
- `height` (total height of editor)
- `canvas_width` (initial canvas width)
- `canvas_height` (initial canvas height)
- `canvas_expansion` (0 if you want to disable scrolling)
- `hide_rulers` (true if you want to hide the canvas rulers)
- `url` (start the canvas with the given svg)
- `hide_menu` (true if you want svg-edit's menu to be hidden)
- `hide_image_tool` (true if you want to hide the image tool button)
- `hide_hyperlink_tool` (true if you want to hide the hyperlink tool button)
- other standard html attributes for the input tag

It is recommended that the database entries associated with sketchily form elements be of type `text`.

The following examples assume that the database table for `@my_object` has a `sketch` column of type `text`.

Example usage (haml):

```haml
= form_for @my_object do |f|
  = f.sketchily :sketch, :hide_menu => true
```

### `sketchily_show` helper

- This function takes the base64-encoded SVG string as an argument and an options hash.
- The SVG string can be directly read from the field used by the `sketchily` and `sketchily_tag` functions.

Currently available options are:

- `width` (width of resulting image object)
- `height` (height of resulting image object)

Passing only one of those options should keep the aspect ratio of the SVG constant in most browsers.

Example usage (haml):

```haml
= sketchily_show @my_object.sketch, :width => "500"
```

## Browser Support

Although more testing is needed, we currently believe sketchily supports any browsers that svg-edit 2.6 supports, namely:

- Firefox 1.5+
- Opera 9.50+
- Safari 4+
- Chrome 1+
- IE 9+
- IE 6+ (with the [Chrome Frame plugin](http://www.google.com/chromeframe))
