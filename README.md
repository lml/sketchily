# Sketchily

Sketchily allows the easy integration of svg-edit with any rails application.

Currently supports and provides `svg-edit-2.6`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sketchily'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sketchily

## Usage

Sketchily adds new form elements which can be accessed by calling:

- `f.sketchily` or simply `sketchily` from inside a `form_for @my_object |f|`
- `sketchily_tag` from inside a `form_tag`

### `f.sketchily` and `sketchily_tag`

- Both of these functions work exactly like the equivalent `hidden_field` functions, except that svg-edit is displayed instead.
- The `f.sketchily` format accepts a method name and an options hash.
- The sketchily format accepts an object name, a method name and an options hash.
- The `sketchily_tag` format accepts a tag name, the svg string to be edited and an options hash.

Currently available options are:

- `width`
- `height`
- `show_menu` (true if you want svg-edit's menu to be displayed)
- `hide_image_tool` (true if you want to hide the image tool button)
- `canvas_width` (number specifying initial canvas width)
- `canvas_height` (number specifying initial canvas height)
- `canvas_expansion` (0 if you want to disable scrolling)
- `hide_rulers` (true if you want to hide the canvas rulers)
- other standard html attributes for the input tag

It is recommended that the database entries associated with sketchily form elements be of type `text`.

Example usage (haml):

    = form_for @shirt do |f|
      f.text_field :title
      f.sketchily :svg
